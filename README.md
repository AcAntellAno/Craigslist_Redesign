#Craigslist_Redesign
#The Problem:
Craigslist's front stayed in the early 2000s. We need to give it a modern twist.

#The Solution:
Flat Design is very popular today and is highly desired in today's web apps. Let's add either one of the following: Bootstrap V4, MaterializeCSS, or SemaniticUI. Either framework will be able to revamp Craigslist UI.

#The Stack:
This will be a complete UI rehaul, but also the TECHStack. So, currently Craigslist is written in PERL, more specifically mod_perl and a little jQuery sprinkled in to taste. Furthermore, Craigslist stuck to a standard LAMP stack (Linux Apache MySQL PHP(but in this case, PERL)), but they maaaybe porting there MySQL DB to MongoDB according to stackshare.io. So, I plan to use a few technologies:
#Frontend
-HTML5, CSS3 (with a possibility of Angular, React, or Vue in the future)

#Backend
-Nodejs, Express, and Ejs for my template engine

#DB
-MongoDB, although the rumors of DB's being dropped scares me...
-Mongoose for my object data mapper

#RESTful
I will try my best to follow REST

#TODOS:
-Set up my require variables
-Create web server
-Create DB Schema
-Create routes
-Landing Page
-Other Pages
-WILL UPDATE AS I GO...i suppose
